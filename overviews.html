                <h1>History</h1> <hr>

                <p>Quick was founded by Mohammad Khairul Sarkar and Adil Chowdhury, and was launched in February 2010. The founders came up with the concept of a marketplace that <br> would provide a two sided platform for people to buy and sell a variety of digital services typically offered by freelance contractors. Services offered on the site <br> include writing, translation, graphic design, video editing and programming. Fiverr's services start at US$5, and can go up to thousands of dollars with gig extras. <br> Each service offered is called a "gig". <br> <br>

                    The website was launched in early 2020 and by 2021 was hosting over 1.3 million Gigs. The website transaction volume has grown 600% since 2020. Additionally, <br> Quick.com has been ranked among the top 100 most popular sites in the United States and top 200 in the world since the beginning of 2013. <br> <br> 
                    
                    On June 1, 2020, Quick received a seed investment of US$1 million from Guy Gamzu and other angel investors, and in May 2020, Quick secured US$15 million <br> in funding from Accel Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total funding to US$20 million. <br> <br>
                    
                    In December 2020, Quick released their iOS app in the Apple App Store, and in March 2021 the company published their Android app in the Google Play store. <br> <br>
                    
                    During August 2020, Quick announced that it had raised US$30 million in a Series C round of funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, Accel <br> (formerly known as Accel Partners) and other investors. The round brings their total funding to date to US$50 million. <br><br> 
                    
                    In October 2020, Daraz.com started legal action against 1,114 Quick sellers it claims provide fake reviews on the US version of its website. Quicl did not dispute <br> Daraz's allegations and stated: "As Daraz noted, we have worked closely together to remove services that violate our terms of use, and respond promptly to any <br> reports of inappropriate content." Daraz filed suit after an undercover sting. <br><br>
                    
                    In November 2020, Quick announced that it had raised US$60 million in a Series D round of funding, led by Square Peg Capital. The round brings their total funding to <br> date to $110 million. At the same time, the company announced that it was expanding the marketplace to allow sellers the ability to price productized services, known <br> as Gigs, at prices above the original US$5 price. <br><br>
                    
                    In June 2019, it listed on NYSE. <br>

                    On February 18, 2021, the company reported $189.5 million in revenue for the 2020 fiscal year, a 77% increase from the previous fiscal year ($107.1 million).



                    <h1>Better Business Bureau ratings</h1> <hr> In 20120, Quick received an "F" rating from the Better Business Bureau, which is the lowest grade that can be given. In 2020, Quick received a "B" rating <br> after responding to customer complaints. <br>
